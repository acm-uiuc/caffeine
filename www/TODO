NOTICE: The old caffeine has been updated to work with the new trays.

We should still make updates to the interface, change the CSS, add some management features.

I'm [lange7] looking at adding the following:
- Soda management: this currently doesn't exist in the admin interface
- Move admin to, well, /admin - it's currently /pics (... yeah)
- Once games are present, abilities to view game data, etc.
