This is the repository for the code in Caffeine 3.0, aka New Caffeine

New Caffeine has been classified "3.0" because we have classified the old
rebuild as "2.0". The New Caffeine is a rather new Coca Cola machine with
nine total slots (designated slot 0 through slot 8). Each slot holds signi-
ficantly more soda than the old machine held. Additionally, we can set a
tray to be in "can" mode and "bottle" mode.

The custom ACM modifications to the machine include:
- LCD tray indicators.
  Where the sample images on a regular machine are, we are putting
  two-ray LCDs with customizable backlight colors. The backlights
  will vary in color from blue, through green, yellow, orange, and
  finally red, to indicate amount of product left. The displays
  themselves will show the product name, price, caffeine, and
  other information (the latter bits scrolling on the second row).
- Linux X/Qt interface.
  Acting as the middle ground between the embedded system that
  controls the machine and the network backend that stores the
  tray items will be an embedded Linux computer, most likely a
  Beagle board or other related system. This computer will run,
  on a small (touch)screen, an embedded X server on which will
  run the graphical elements of the new machine.
- Game interface.
  As an added bonus, and with the capabilities of the LCD displays,
  we are planning to add some games to the machine, such as Space
  Invaders. This is all subject to whatever extra time we have and
  no work on it will be done until the system works like the old one.
